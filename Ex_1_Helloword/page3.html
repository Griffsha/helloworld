        <h1>Well I am Wangkai Sha</I></h1>
       
        <p>I started learning web design because, back in 2023, I boldly declared that I would create my own designer website. At the time, I was full of ambition and ready to dive into learning—only to somehow end up studying Java instead. To this day, I still have no idea how my scattered thinking took me from building a website to aspiring to become an outstanding coder. Maybe it was the allure of the AI era, or maybe I was just aimlessly dabbling here and there. Yet even now, I have no clue where the first page of my portfolio website is. It’s already 2025, and with only six months left before I graduate, I guess I should at least put together a damn webpage to make it look like I tried.</p>
